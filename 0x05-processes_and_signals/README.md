Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in operating systems and computer programming. Here's a brief description of each:

Processes:
- A process is an independent unit of execution in an operating system. It represents a running program along with its current state, including variables, file descriptors, and other resources. Each process operates in its own memory space, isolated from other processes, providing data protection and security.
- Processes are managed by the operating system's process scheduler, which determines when and for how long each process gets to run on the CPU. The scheduler switches between processes rapidly, giving the illusion of concurrent execution even on single-core systems.
- Processes can communicate with each other using various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, like pipes, sockets, shared memory, and signals.

Signals:
- Signals are software interrupts used to notify processes about specific events or conditions. They are used for inter-process communication and process management in Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS).
- Signals can be generated by the operating system, hardware, or other processes. Common examples of signal-triggering events include process termination, hardware errors, keyboard interrupts (e.g., Ctrl+C), or custom signals sent by other processes.
- When a process receives a signal, it can choose how to handle it, which can range from ignoring the signal, terminating the process gracefully, or catching the signal and performing custom actions.
- Signals provide a way for processes to communicate and coordinate with each other, allowing them to handle exceptional situations and synchronize their actions.
