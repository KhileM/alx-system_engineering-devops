SSH, or Secure Shell, is a network protocol and cryptographic technology used for secure communication over a potentially unsecured network, such as the internet. It is commonly used to establish secure, encrypted connections between a client and a server, allowing for secure remote access and data transfer. SSH provides authentication and encryption, making it a widely used method for remotely managing and administering computers and servers, as well as for secure file transfers. It is a crucial tool for securing and protecting sensitive data and systems in various IT and networking contexts.
