A web server is software or hardware that serves as the backbone of the World Wide Web, enabling the delivery of web content to clients, typically web browsers, upon request. It handles incoming HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests, processes them, and sends back the appropriate web pages, files, or resources in response. Web servers are responsible for hosting and delivering websites, applications, and various forms of online content to users over the internet. They can serve both static content (like HTML files and images) and dynamic content (which is generated on-the-fly by applications and databases). Popular web server software includes Apache, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and others.
