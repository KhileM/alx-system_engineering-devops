HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used for secure communication over the internet. It is an extension of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), the standard protocol for transmitting data between a web browser and a website's server. HTTPS adds a layer of security by encrypting the data exchanged between the client (usually a web browser) and the web server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data, remains confidential and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by malicious actors.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to the newer TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, but both SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols used to establish secure connections over a network, such as the internet. SSL/TLS protocols enable encryption, authentication, and data integrity, making them essential for securing online communications. SSL certificates are used to verify the identity of websites and establish a secure connection between the client and the server. In modern usage, when people refer to SSL, they often mean both SSL and TLS interchangeably, as TLS has largely replaced SSL due to its improved security features.
