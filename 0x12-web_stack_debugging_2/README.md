Web stack debugging refers to the process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs that occur within the various layers of a web application's technology stack. This technology stack typically includes the frontend, backend, database, and server components. 

The process usually involves:

1. **Identifying the Problem:** This step involves recognizing the symptoms of the issue, such as errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior, and narrowing down the affected layer of the technology stack.

2. **Isolating the Issue:** Once the layer with the issue is identified, the next step is to isolate the specific component or code responsible for the problem.

3. **Analyzing the Logs:** Examining logs from different parts of the stack can provide crucial insights into the root cause of the issue. These logs may contain information about errors, warnings, or other relevant data points.

4. **Using Debugging Tools:** Leveraging debugging tools, such as integrated development environment (IDE) debuggers, browser developer tools, or specialized logging libraries, can help in tracing the flow of data and identifying potential issues within the code.

5. **Testing and Reiterating:** After making changes to fix the issue, it is important to test the application thoroughly to ensure that the problem has been resolved without introducing new bugs.

Overall, web stack debugging requires a systematic approach, a strong understanding of the application's architecture, and proficiency in various debugging techniques and tools to effectively identify and resolve issues within the web technology stack.
