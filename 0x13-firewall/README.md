A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet, and helps to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be hardware, software, or a combination of both, and they are essential for protecting networks from various cyber threats, including hackers, viruses, worms, and other malicious entities. They play a critical role in ensuring network security and data integrity.
