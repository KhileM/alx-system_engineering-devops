MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and querying data. It operates through a client-server model, where the server manages the database and responds to queries from various client applications.

When a client application sends a query to the MySQL server, the server processes the query using the MySQL query optimizer and query execution engine. The query optimizer determines the most efficient way to execute the query, considering factors like indexes, table sizes, and available resources. The execution engine then carries out the query and returns the results to the client.

MySQL stores data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. It supports various data types, including numeric, string, and date/time types, among others. It also provides features such as transactions, stored procedures, triggers, and views, which enable complex data management and manipulation.

Furthermore, MySQL allows users to control access and permissions at various levels, ensuring data security and integrity. It also supports various storage engines, which provide different ways to store and retrieve data, catering to different use cases and performance requirements.
