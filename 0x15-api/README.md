An API (Application Programming Interface) in software development acts as an intermediary that enables two applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs allow different software systems to interact and share data seamlessly, facilitating the development of complex software applications. They enable developers to integrate functionality from external sources without having to understand the inner workings of the system they are integrating with. APIs are crucial for creating robust and scalable software architectures, facilitating the building of interconnected systems and enabling the development of innovative applications by leveraging the capabilities of other software components.
